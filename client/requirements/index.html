		Requirements
		</h1>
		<h3>Why we have requirements</h3>
		<p>We have requirements to who can use Mattcoin because we need to ensure the integrity of Mattcoin and find its target audience. Theres really only a few and well explain all of them.</p>
		<h3>You need to have a Scratcher Status Account</h3>
		<p>Mattcoin can be embedded in projects so people can donate to other people or/and buy ingame items withing scratch projects. All this requires some mild use of cloud data. We also require Scratcher status because is how us, Mattcoin, makes sure that people don't attempt to game the system with bots/
		<h3>You need an Email</h3>
		<p>You need an email to use Scratch aswell, but we use an email for the recovery of your Mattcoin account (since we dont ask for a password). We will ask you to verify this email before being able
			to participate in the Mattcoin economy</p>
		<h3>You need to be over 13 years old (for the most part)</h3>
		<p>To raise any chargebacks or contact the support in any way you need to be over 13 years old because this technically counts as communication outside scratch. We do, however, have a support on
		Scratch (@mattcoinsupport) for those to not wish to use the support email (mtcscratch@gmail.com). The obvious drawback to using the scratch support is that everyone can see who you are trying to chargeback.</p>
