		Terms of service
		</h1>
		<h3>
		PROLOGUE:
		</h3>
		<p>
		This document will serve as an end to end agreement between the user and the
		service (Mattcoin). Failure to abide to these terms after
		account creation could result in account termination and the liquidation
		of all the assets associated to the mattcoin account in question.
		Furthermore, we also manifest the right to terminate a mattcoin account
		if we feel a certain user is abusing our service for any other
		purpose for that of which it was originally created - a way of
		payment between individuals in scratch.
		</p>

		<h3>
		Chargebacks I. I.
		</h3>
		<p>
		Mattcoin will serve as a middle-man for payments between individuals.
		This means we are liable for any fraudulent agreements done through
		mattcoin and therefore must go through certain steps to protect the
		assets of a certain individual from fraud.
		</p>
		<h3>
		I. II.
		</h3>
		<p>
		One of the ways we will protect our users is by introducing a system
		that includes that of a "pending balance". With this all payments received
		through mattcoin will undergo a 48 hour cooldown before being able to be
		used again. We have this system in place to give the user enough time
		to report a fraud before the amount originally sent trickles down
		to different accounts. This also prevents scammers from having different
		"Vault Accounts" to avoid the liquidation of their assets for violating
		the TOS or committing a fraudulent agreement with an individual.
		</p>
		<h3>
		I. III.
		</h3>
		<p>
		The following only applies to written agreements.
		As stated in (I. II.) we will introduce the system of "Chargebacks"
		aswell. This is only to be used when fraud has taken place on
		the scratch.mit.edu platform and is open to interpretation of the
		public. Failure to provide a scratch link to the original conversation
		in scratch will result in a chargeback getting denies. This gets at two
		things: First off any agreements made on an external communication
		platform other than scratch won't be eligible for a chargeback as it
		is a direct violation of the scratch community guidelines. Furthermore,
		we recommend making all agreements on a scratch studio instead of on
		someone's profile to prevent a scammer from deleting a conversation
		to avoid being charged back.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following only applies to Mattcoin Business (Embedded terminals
		within scratch projects)
		</p>
		<p>
		To issue a chargeback done through Mattcoin Business (from now on
		mtcbuis) it is required to provide a link to the project in question.
		A chargeback will be accepted if the following is true: the project
		is using an altered version of payment terminal that is
		found here or didnâ€™t deliver the digital assets it had promised on
		the project (or any attempts at deception for that matter). If the
		original project is unshared we would need the full username of
		the original author and the name of the original project instead. We
		will still be able to check the project since mattcoin automatically
		stores a private remix of all projects registered through mtcbuis for
		your protection.
		</p>
		<h3>
		I. IV.
		</h3>
		<p>
		As it should be fairly understood by now, any attempts of deception
		will result in your account getting terminated by the service
		administrators.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Misuse of service II. I.
		</h3>
		<p>
		As stated in the introduction of this agreement, any misuse of this
		system will result in immediate termination. Here we will mention some
		of the actions that would result in such however everything is open
		to interpretation by the service administrators and your actions should
		not only be limited by what is listed on this document as we manifest the
		right to terminate your account with no notice for something we feel
		was abused on our system.
		</p>
		<h3>
		II. II.
		</h3>
		<p>
		Any actions agreed upon the service administrators to be deceptive or
		abusive will usually result in a strike (usually being the main keyword
		here since we can still terminate your account for something we consider
		a mayor offense). Every account starts with a clean record of 0 strikes,
		however upon reaching 3 strikes your account will be granted with a
		permanent termination and furthermore your public ip address, which we log for
		the security of the system, will be banned from the system. These actions include, but
		are not limited to: fraudulent agreements, hijacking the system for
		a higher balance, misusing the currency, etc.
		</p>
		<h3>
		II. III.
		</h3>
		<p>
		The value of mattcoin is determined through a miner (see here for more info).
		Similar to bitcoin, different parties will use a specialized program that
		will use the computing resources found on your personal pc to solve a bunch
		of hashing algorithms (mathematical problems). In return the individual will
		be awarded with the currency, giving the mattcoin value. MTC is not a decentralized
		currency however, as we feel it is not healthy for the currency to
		rely on multiple servers that are most likely only going to be running for
		a couple of hours at a time.
		</p>
		<p>
		The following includes actions that are restricted with the miner program. One of
		these includes overloading our API with fraudulent answers for the SHA-256
		algorithm (This would be considered a DOS attack). We do not restrict
		access to alterations of the miner program (we actually encourage it),
		however we recommend you have knowledge of what you are doing in order
		to avoid a loss breaking the mining program.
		</p>
		<h3>
		II. IV.
		</h3>
		<p>
		This should be fairly understood by now, but any attempts to take down
		the system through the API (be dos attacks or anything else) will result
		in immediate termination of your account and an ip ban.
		</p>
		<h3>
		Conclusion.
		</h3>
		<p>
		By signing up for the service to agree to this document and agree
		to abide by it. This document is subject to change.
